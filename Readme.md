# Mirror for Stanford CS143 Directory

This is a mirror of the starter directory for CS143 from Stanford.

## How do I use this?

Run the script `run.sh` to get an shell into the docker container. From there you can run commands like:


```sh
make -f /usr/class/cs143/assignments/PA2J/Makefile
```

And they will work.
